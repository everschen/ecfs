	  This is the next generation of the ext3 filesystem.

	  Unlike the change from ext2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem,
	  the on-disk format of ecfs is not forwards compatible with
	  ext3; it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit
	  physical block numbers.  The ecfs filesystem also supports delayed
	  allocation, persistent preallocation, high resolution time stamps,
	  and a number of other features to improve performance and speed
	  up fsck time.  For more information, please see the web pages at
	  http://ecfs.wiki.kernel.org.

	  The ecfs filesystem supports mounting an ext3 filesystem; while there
	  are some performance gains from the delayed allocation and inode
	  table readahead, the best performance gains require enabling ecfs
	  features in the filesystem using tune2fs, or formatting a new
	  filesystem as an ecfs filesystem initially. Without explicit enabling
	  of ecfs features, the on disk filesystem format stays fully backward
	  compatible.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here. The
	  module will be called ecfs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ECFS_USE_FOR_EXT2

	help
	  Allow the ecfs file system driver code to be used for ext2
	  file system mounts.  This allows users to reduce their
	  compiled kernel size by using one file system driver for
	  ext2, ext3, and ecfs file systems.

config ECFS_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "Ecfs POSIX Access Control Lists"
	depends on ECFS_FS
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	help
	  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N

config ECFS_FS_SECURITY
	bool "Ecfs Security Labels"
	depends on ECFS_FS
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the ecfs filesystem.

	  If you are not using a security module that requires using
	  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.

config ECFS_DEBUG
	bool "Ecfs debugging support"
	depends on ECFS_FS
	help
	  Enables run-time debugging support for the ecfs filesystem.

	  If you select Y here, then you will be able to turn on debugging
	  using dynamic debug control for mb_debug() / ext_debug() msgs.

	default KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
	help
	  This builds the ecfs KUnit tests.

	  KUnit tests run during boot and output the results to the debug log
	  in TAP format (https://testanything.org/). Only useful for kernel devs
	  running KUnit test harness and are not for inclusion into a production
	  build.

	  For more information on KUnit and unit tests in general please refer
	  to the KUnit documentation in Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/.

	  If unsure, say N.
